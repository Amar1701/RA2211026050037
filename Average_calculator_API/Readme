Solution Approach
For Choosing a Backend Framework !

Since external libraries for algorithms are not allowed, we can use FastAPI (Python) or Spring Boot (Java).
I'll use FastAPI (Python) for this solution.
Setup the API Endpoints

/numbers/{numberid} â†’ Fetches numbers from the third-party API, maintains a sliding window, and calculates the average.
Key Implementation Details

Fetch numbers from the given test API.
Maintain a unique sliding window (max size = 10).
Remove duplicate values from the fetched API response.
Handle API failures or slow responses (over 500ms timeout).
Return JSON response in the required format.
